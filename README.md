### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Thomas, a Front end ish dev but effectively I just like programming.

I'm genrally creating some madcap idea or other, mostly around user generated sites or dynamic content. 

Currently I'm developing a content aggregator in NextJs.

Generally doing some courses - my focus at the moment is a little more backend knowledge in Node.
